## Welcome to the Gruntled browser extension
### Created by @borntonguyen, @leepriscilla, @rickyg365, and @cvraut


Gruntled is a browser extension that allows users to record their reaction to a YouTube video, generate a link so they can send to friends that will consolidate their reactions to the respective video.


Here's a link to an [in-progress prototype](https://invis.io/6812JG27S2X3#/465300953_Base)
& [a video tutorial on how to get it running on your machine](https://streamable.com/1552os)

2) Click anywhere on the proto to highlight hotzones to progress through the prototype. <br>

<h5 align="center">  Hypothesis </h5>

We believe creating a reaction-sharing browser extension for YouTube content consumers will give users more enjoyment & connection.
We will know this is true when we see an increase of reaction videos created with our extension.
